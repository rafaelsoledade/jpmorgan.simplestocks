## Motivation

This project is a simple stocks manager. It includes the use of several Java and OOP concepts such as inheritance, interfaces, abstract classes, generic types, static methods, amongst others. It also has a unitary test component.
The project was developed in Java using the Eclipse IDE, and it's a Maven project. The libraries used are Jackson and Google's JSON-Simple, used for deserializing a JSON file with a test data array.
The project was compiled using Java 8.

## Project Description

#####Â Requirements

1.	Provide working source code that will:

a.	For a given stock:
    i.    Calculate the dividend yield.
    ii. Calculate the P/E Ratio.
    iii.  Record a trade, with timestamp, quantity of shares, buy or sell indicator and price.
    iv.   Calculate Stock Price based on trades recorded in past 15 minutes.

    b.	Calculate the GBCE All Share Index using the geometric mean of prices for all stocks

##### Constraints & Notes

1.	Written in one of these languages:
    
    * Java, C#, C++, Python.
    
2.	No database or GUI is required, all data need only be held in memory.

3.	Formulas and data provided are simplified representations for the purpose of this exercise.

## How To Run

After pulling the project from GitHub, you can compile it using mvn with the following command

     mvn clean install

To run the program as a Java application use the command

     mvn exec:java

## Program Interface

A very simple command line interface was added, from which the user can select an operation and view the result. Alternatively, this could be done via a web service using simple Spark or Spring setups in a future release.

## Tests

The project has a unit test component, implemented with JUnit 4. To run the tests, use the command

     mvn clean test
